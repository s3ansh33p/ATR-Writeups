## Points

Easy - 200 points

## Description

An unknown message was found on a piece of paper, can you decode and relay it to our team?

## Solution

Groups are divided in to two, one sending a message in morse code, and the others trying to decipher it. This can be done by turning a light on and off.

The flag `ATR{M0R53_C0D3_15_C00L}` was provided by the organiser running the challenge upon successful encoding and decoding of a message.
