## Description

The R&D team have collaborated with the HR team to conduct an organisation wide challenge as part of their research project. Teams have to work together to build a toy car and cross the finish line.

## Solution

One player takes turns tossing ping pong balls into cups, while the rest of the team works on assembling the car with the available parts. However, not all components are initially accessible. When a player successfully lands a ping pong ball into a cup, that cup is removed, and a new component is provided to the team. The player who just scored joins the rest of the team in building the car, while another teammate takes over the ball tossing. This cycle continues each time a ping pong ball successfully lands in a cup. 

1. Players cannot attempt a second turn at tossing ping pong balls until all other players have landed a ping pong ball into a cup.
2. Teams do not have to acquire all components to complete the activity.
3. All acquired parts must be used/on the car when in use.
4. Car must cross start and finish line without anyone touching it.

Catch: some parts are good (bigger gears) other parts are bad (dead weight). Teams aren't told this, nor are they told which cup corresponds to which component, only that all parts must be used.

Upon successful completion of the challenge, the team will be awarded the flag `ATR{CFO_N33D5_2_GO}`.
