## Points

Medium - 800 points

## Description

Standing before you is the Scientist’s giant display, filled with a giant wall of text that is pre-programmed to self-destruct line by line.
Your gut tells you that this is crucial information and may be the key to understanding what happened to Justina Panetta.
Can you outsmart the Scientist’s brain in a battle of memory?

## Solution

Participants work in a team on a single laptop and attempt to remember as many lines of code as they can.

On the display, there will be a snippet of code that the participants have 10 seconds to remember

A judge will look over the code once time is up and will be awarded 100 points for each question if they can remember at least the general layout of the code

There is a 4th piece of code that is worth 500 points. They will have 20 seconds to remember as much as they can

- `ATR{5UM_0F_D0U8L3_NUM5}` - 100 points
- `ATR{TH3_G0LD3N_R4T10_M4N}` - 100 points
- `ATR{THR33_ST3P_B1N4RY}` - 100 points
- `ATR{STR4SS3N_TH3_H3LL_0UT}` - 500 points (main flag)

Note: It seems this challenge wasn't run during the event.
