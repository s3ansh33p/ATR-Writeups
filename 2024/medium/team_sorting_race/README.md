# Team Sorting Race

[Back to Home](../../README.md)

## Points

Medium - 300 points

## Description

Work as a team to the server blocks back in order, using a sorting algorithm.

## Solution

Magnetic blocks are placed number side down, in an unordered way, on the whiteboards. 

Contestants have two choices to make:

- Sorting strategy: no algorithm (150 points), bubble sort (250 points), merge sort (300 points)
- See or touch: each member of the group can either see or touch the blocks, not both.

The seeing people will guide the blind to move the objects around in sorted order to reveal the main flag. The items can only be put down in their designated spots.

Upon successful completion of the challenge, the team will be awarded the flag `ATR{D15CR1M1N4T1NG_S0RT1NG_4LG0R1THMS}`.

If the team chooses to use the bubble sort algorithm, they will be awarded the subflag `ATR{8U88L3_S0RT}`.

If the team chooses to use the merge sort algorithm, they will be awarded the subflag `ATR{M3RG3_N3RDS}`.
