## Points

Medium - 300 points

## Description

No museum, no matter how large, would be complete without a highly protected prize. The Lion’s Eye Diamond is a superdense glittering crystal, an entire nebula given solid form. Previously stolen by pirates, physical access to the gem requires traversal of miles of tight nanotitanium alloy tunnels, complete with lasers and motion sensors and the works. The Diamond is your secondary prize, however, as you know its cage also holds critical information about the Grand Treasure. 

Get in, and get out.

*This activity is in-person, in the Lion's Eye Diamond exhibit.*

## Solution

Adapted from a 2023 challenge, this activity involves carefully navigating a maze of red string (representing lasers). On the other side of the room is a rock with a hidden compartment that contains the flag.

Participants needed to get through the maze without touching the string. If they did, they would need to start again.

Upon completion, they would find the flag inside the rock, which was `ATR{tr34sur3_b3y0nd_w34lth}`.
