## Description

Some dates in history hold a great weight, acting as flagposts to give some sense to the vast gulfs of time since humanity first reached the stars. They're also a common way to hide codes. Your crew knows this, and when searching for a treasure this hidden, every potential hiding place should be searched. Write down important dates from anywhere you can find them, and maybe you can find some meaning from them.

*This activity is in-person, and is a scavenger hunt through all the different rooms.*
*Flags will be submitted as a 4-digit year, without ATR{}.*
